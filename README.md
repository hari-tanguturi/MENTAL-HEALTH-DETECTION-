**📌 Project Overview**
Mental health issues often go unnoticed until it’s too late. This project focuses on identifying potential suicide risk and mental health distress using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

The system analyzes user-provided text (and optional voice input converted to text) and predicts whether the content indicates suicidal tendencies or emotional distress. The goal is early detection, not diagnosis, to encourage timely help and awareness.

**🎯 Objectives**

Detect suicidal or distress-related content from user input

Use machine learning for text-based mental health analysis

Provide a simple and user-friendly interface

Demonstrate practical application of NLP in healthcare
